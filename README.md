Housing-Prediction-Project

The UK housing market is a trillion pound market, in 2021 the UK housing market recorded £670bn increase, taking it to a 
total of £9.5tn. There is an estimated 28.1 million houshold in the UK. Between March 2020 and March 2021 there were a recorded
674,263 residential property sales.
These type of numbers allows us to investigate further at factors like the value of property types and and if the increase in 
value is proportional to increased number of rooms.
This kind of analysis will also allow us to see if there is correlation with property value and socioeconomic status of geolocations
accross the UK.

The project scope is to gather enough data that we can make sophisticated predictions on property value based on some key features and
geolocation.
These predictions will come from a mathematical model used in linear regression called gradient decent. A optimimzation algorithm 
often used for machine learning, it calculates a line of best fit(LBF) from existing data based on error values and returns a LBF
that has the lowest error value.


Languages: C#, Python, Jupyter Notebooks (not limited to)

C#: Creating a forms application that allows for user to input data and then export to a .CSV file, the relevent data 
is imported to a python project in Jupyter to carry out some mathematical analysis with visualisations.

To begin the project but not limited to the following records.

Data Recorded:
1)  Number of Rooms
2)  Value of Property
3)  County/Location
4)  Housing Type
    - Appartment
    - Detached
    - Terraced
    - Bungalow


Python: The Python portion of the project is carrying out some basic data manipulation to get a visual understanding of regional data,
which will be merged with country wide data where multiple factors are accounted for.

Data Output:

1)  Relation of value of property and number of rooms, w/ comparisons
2)  Relation of value of property and house type, w/ comparisons
3)  Relation of value of property and geolocation, w/ comparisons
4)  Predictive tool
    - In an attempt to guide sellers make the best price prediction of a property.
